## Pete's Portfolio Page

### Introduction

This repo is my personal portfolio landing page. The intent was to create a quick and easy reference point to share my data science projects to showcase my work and provide the links to source code for those who are interested in seeing what was done. 

### Github Pages

This page was built using the free Github Pages becasue I wanted a low cost way to host this basic info, this is the reason for the .github.io extension on the URL.

### Markdown

This site is written in Markdown and rendered using some HTML code. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
